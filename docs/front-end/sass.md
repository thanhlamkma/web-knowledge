# SASS

## Store Data with Sass Variables

One feature of Sass that's different than CSS is it uses variables. They are declared and set to store data, similar to JavaScript.

In JavaScript, variables are defined using the `let` and `const` keywords. In Sass, variables start with a `$` followed by the variable name.

Here are a couple examples:

```scss
$main-fonts: Arial, sans-serif;
$headings-color: green;
```

And to use the variables:

```scss
h1 {
  font-family: $main-fonts;
  color: $headings-color;
}
```

One example where variables are useful is when a number of elements need to be the same color. If that color is changed, the only place to edit the code is the variable value.

## Nest CSS

Sass allows nesting of CSS rules, which is a useful way of organizing a style sheet.

Normally, each element is targeted on a different line to style it, like so:

```scss
article {
  height: 200px;
}

article p {
  color: white;
}

article ul {
  color: blue;
}
```

For a large project, the CSS file will have many lines and rules. This is where nesting can help organize your code by placing child style rules within the respective parent elements:

```scss
article {
  height: 200px;

  p {
    color: white;
  }

  ul {
    color: blue;
  }
}
```

## Create Reusable CSS with Mixins

In Sass, a mixin is a group of CSS declarations that can be reused throughout the style sheet. The definition starts with the `@mixin` at-rule, followed by a custom name. You apply the mixin using the `@include` at-rule.

```scss
@mixin reset-list {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  list-style: none;
}

nav ul {
  @include reset-list;
}
```

Compiles to:

```css
nav ul {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  list-style: none;
}
```

Your mixins can also take arguments, which allows their behavior to be customized. The arguments are required when using the mixin.

```scss
@mixin prose($font-size, $spacing) {
  font-size: $font-size;
  margin: 0;
  margin-block-end: $spacing;
}

p {
  @include prose(1.25rem, 1rem);
}

h2 {
  @include prose(2.4rem, 1.5rem);
}
```

You can make arguments optional by giving the parameters default values.

```scss
@mixin text-color($color: black) {
  color: $color;
}

p {
  @include text-color(); /* color: black */
}

nav a {
  @include text-color(orange);
}
```

## Add Logic to Your Styles (@mixin)

The `@if` directive in Sass is useful to test for a specific case - it works just like the `if` statement in JavaScript.

```scss
@mixin make-bold($bool) {
  @if $bool == true {
    font-weight: bold;
  }
}
```

And just like in JavaScript, the `@else if` and `@else` directives test for more conditions:

```scss
@mixin text-effect($val) {
  @if $val == danger {
    color: red;
  } @else if $val == alert {
    color: yellow;
  } @else if $val == success {
    color: green;
  } @else {
    color: black;
  }
}
```

## Create Sass Loop (@for)

The `@for` directive adds styles in a loop, very similar to a `for` loop in JavaScript.

`@for` is used in two ways: "start through end" or "start to end". The main difference is that the "start **to** end" *excludes* the end number as part of the count, and "start **through** end" *includes* the end number as part of the count.

Here's a start **through** end example:

```scss
@for $i from 1 through 12 {
  .col-#{$i} {
    width: 100%/12 * $i;
  }
}
```

The `#{$i}` part is the syntax to combine a variable (`i`) with text to make a string. When the Sass file is converted to CSS, it looks like this:

```scss
.col-1 {
  width: 8.33333%;
}

.col-2 {
  width: 16.66667%;
}

... .col-12 {
  width: 100%;
}
```

This is a powerful way to create a grid layout. Now you have twelve options for column widths available as CSS classes.

## Map Over Items in a List (@each)

The last challenge showed how the `@for` directive uses a starting and ending value to loop a certain number of times. Sass also offers the `@each` directive which loops over each item in a list or map. On each iteration, the variable gets assigned to the current value from the list or map.

```scss
@each $color in blue, red, green {
  .#{$color}-text {
    color: $color;
  }
}
```

A map has slightly different syntax. Here's an example:

```scss
$colors: (
  color1: blue,
  color2: red,
  color3: green,
);

@each $key, $color in $colors {
  .#{$color}-text {
    color: $color;
  }
}
```

Note that the `$key` variable is needed to reference the keys in the map. Otherwise, the compiled CSS would have `color1`, `color2`... in it. Both of the above code examples are converted into the following CSS:

```scss
.blue-text {
  color: blue;
}

.red-text {
  color: red;
}

.green-text {
  color: green;
}
```

# # Apply a Style Until a Condition is Met (@while)

The `@while` directive is an option with similar functionality to the JavaScript `while` loop. It creates CSS rules until a condition is met.

The `@for` challenge gave an example to create a simple grid system. This can also work with `@while`.

```scss
$x: 1;
@while $x < 13 {
  .col-#{$x} {
    width: 100%/12 * $x;
  }
  $x: $x + 1;
}
```

First, define a variable `$x` and set it to 1. Next, use the `@while` directive to create the grid system *while* `$x` is less than 13. After setting the CSS rule for `width`, `$x` is incremented by 1 to avoid an infinite loop.

# Split Your Styles into Smaller Chunks with Partials

Partials in Sass are separate files that hold segments of CSS code. These are imported and used in other Sass files. This is a great way to group similar code into a module to keep it organized.

Names for partials start with the underscore (`_`) character, which tells Sass it is a small segment of CSS and not to convert it into a CSS file. Also, Sass files end with the `.scss` file extension. To bring the code in the partial into another Sass file, use the `@import` directive.

For example, if all your mixins are saved in a partial named "\_mixins.scss", and they are needed in the "main.scss" file, this is how to use them in the main file:

```scss
@import "mixins";
```

Note that the underscore and file extension are not needed in the `import` statement - Sass understands it is a partial. Once a partial is imported into a file, all variables, mixins, and other code are available to use.

# Extend One Set of CSS Styles to Another Element

Sass has a feature called `extend` that makes it easy to borrow the CSS rules from one element and build upon them in another.

For example, the below block of CSS rules style a `.panel` class. It has a `background-color`, `height` and `border`.

```scss
.panel {
  background-color: red;
  height: 70px;
  border: 2px solid green;
}
```

Now you want another panel called `.big-panel`. It has the same base properties as `.panel`, but also needs a `width` and `font-size`. It's possible to copy and paste the initial CSS rules from `.panel`, but the code becomes repetitive as you add more types of panels. The `extend` directive is a simple way to reuse the rules written for one element, then add more for another:

```scss
.big-panel {
  @extend .panel;
  width: 150px;
  font-size: 2em;
}
```

The `.big-panel` will have the same properties as `.panel` in addition to the new styles.
